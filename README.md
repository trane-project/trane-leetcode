# trane-leetcode

An official [Trane](https://github.com/trane-project/trane) course for learning to solve LeetCode
problems. The questions were selected from [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/). Shout out to them
for going over the work of organizing a subset of Leetcode questions by topic and difficulty. You
can watch a video answer for all the questions in these courses on their site.

# How to use these courses

1. Install [trane-cli](https://github.com/trane-project/trane-cli) on your computer. This is the
   command line interface for Trane.
1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
1. Go to the directory where you downloaded this repository and run `trane`. You will be presented
   with the command line interface for Trane.
1. Run the command `open ./` to load the courses into Trane.
1. Run the command `next` to show the next question. Each question is just a text file telling you
   to solve a specific problem along with its URL.
1. Once you have solved the problem (see below on what that means), you can set a score from 1 to
   5 by running the command `score <score>`. Running `score` multiple times will update the score,
   and it is only submitted when you request a new question.
1. Run `next` to show the next question.

As you progress through the first exercises, Trane will automatically move on to questions of a
higher difficulty while also reminding you to review questions you have seen before.

For more documentation, see the official [docs](https://trane-project.github.io/trane-cli.html).

# How to solve a problem

Unlike an exercise asking you to perform a piece of music or to solve a chess puzzle, the problems
in these courses are more open-ended. What solving the problem means is up to you. You could force
yourself to code the solution from scratch every time you are shown a problem, but this could get
old soon. You could also code it the first time, and just draft a solution in pseudocode afterwords.
Or you could simply review the solution and assign yourself a score based on how much of it you
remembered.

If you are stuck on a problem, it's OK to look at the solution. Just make sure you assign yourself a
low score (1 or 2).
